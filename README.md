# Welcome to Zoo Animals

Welcome to Zoo Animals! A very simple app to showcase some basics of SwiftUI and Combine. The app is super simple:
1. A home screen that displays 1-10 animals getting the results from an [API](https://zoo-animal-api.herokuapp.com)
2. A detailed view screen triggered by tapping on a list item that displays even more animal information
3. A settings screen where the user can choose in what format they would like measurements to be displayed i.e. kg's, lb's, cm etc

Also is the ability is change the request of how many results the user is getting back. I've tried to be varied in my approach here with the UI and conform to the fundamentals of [Apple's Human Interface Guidelines](https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/guidelines/overview/), so you can see a wide variety of UI: Slider, Picker, Sheet, TabView, NavigationView just to name some

The project is by no means complete. Combine is pretty new to me, and i'm constantly learning so my practices will improve over time. I've architectured everything roughly into an MVVM like structure, again not something I'm super used to (I am actually more used to [the Composable Architecture](https://github.com/pointfreeco/swift-composable-architecture#examples). Alas, much can be improved. Test's for starters and a slightly more refined UI would be a good place to start.
